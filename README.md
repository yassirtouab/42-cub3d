## Description

#### This game is done using the raycasting way where I sent vectors from the starting position of the player that checks everytime it hits a grid till it reaches a wall '1' and then calculate the exact distance by taking the grid size as a 1 unit. Depending on the distance from the player to the wall, the vertical size of the wall is calculated.

#### You can start the game as said before in QuickStart. For the moves, you can using the keys (WASD) and use the arrows to look around or you can use the mouse inside the window.
